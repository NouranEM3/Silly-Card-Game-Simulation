# Silly-Card-Game-Simulation
My first programming project! A console-based Java simulation of a two-player card game, featuring custom stack and queue implementations, modular design, and a Fisher-Yates shuffle algorithm. Developed to practice object-oriented programming and learn core software development concepts."
